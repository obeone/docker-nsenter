# üöÄ docker-nsenter

The docker-nsenter script allows you to enter various namespaces of a Docker container, simplifying nsenter commands and making it easy to target running containers.

## üì• Installation

1. Save the docker-nsenter.sh script in a directory within your $PATH. Note: Rename the script to docker-nsenter (without the .sh extension) for optimal compatibility with the ZSH completion script.

```bash
mv docker-nsenter.sh /usr/local/bin/docker-nsenter
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-nsenter
```

2. If you want to use ZSH autocompletion, install the _docker-nsenter.zsh file:

- Move the file to your ZSH completion folder:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.zsh/completions
mv _docker-nsenter.zsh ~/.zsh/completions/_docker-nsenter
```

- Add the completion folder to your fpath if it‚Äôs not already set, and reload your ZSH configuration:

```bash
echo 'fpath+=(~/.zsh/completions)' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

3. Autocompletion is now enabled! You can start using docker-nsenter with autocompletion by pressing [TAB] after the command name to see available options and running containers.

## üõ† Usage

docker-nsenter Command

The docker-nsenter command provides options to enter specific namespaces (network, pid, etc.) of a Docker container using nsenter.

### üñ•Ô∏è Example usage

```bash
docker-nsenter --net <container name or ID>
```

Other example commands:

- To enter the PID namespace:

```bash
docker-nsenter --pid <container name or ID>
```

- To enter multiple namespaces, e.g., network and mount:

```bash
docker-nsenter --net --mount <container name or ID>
```

## ZSH Completion üéâ

The ZSH completion script provides:

- nsenter options with both short and long versions, making typing easier.
- A dynamic list of running Docker container names for quick selection.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Command Naming
>
> For optimal ZSH completion functionality, the command should be installed without an extension (docker-nsenter). If you choose to keep the .sh extension, you‚Äôll need to modify the completion script accordingly.
